git clone https://github.com/haartmuhn/byte-write.git
cd byte-write
```

2.  Install the dependencies:

 7. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3001` to view the application.

 Note: The following adjustments were made to the project files to enable deployment to RENDER:

 -  **server.js**
    -   Ensured the session secret is fetched from environment variables.
    -   Configured the `express.static` to use `path.join` for serving static files.

-   **config/connection.js**
    -   Updated to use `DATABASE_URL` environment variable for the PostgreSQL connection.
    -   Enabled SSL connection for PostgreSQL.

-   **.env**
    -   Added `DATABASE_URL` for the PostgreSQL connection string.
    -   Added `SESSION_SECRET` for the session secret.
